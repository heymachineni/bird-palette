            Why I built this

          <p className="mt-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            In the world I see, nature is already beautiful, and birds especially
            so. Look at almost any species and you&apos;ll find a color combination
            that feels complete in its own way: contrast, balance, and character
            already solved.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            I started Bird Palette to collect those combinations, real plumage
            colors, not guesses, and make them easy to browse and search. Take
            inspiration, or just wander through to see how many colors each bird
            carries and how they come together.

            Notes
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            I&apos;m actively working on this, so you may run into rough edges,
            missing photos, or colors that still need tuning. I&apos;m trying to
            make the site more accurate and smoother over time.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Each palette is sampled from the bird&apos;s photo, with real light
            and real pose. A bit of background can slip in sometimes, and I am
            still tuning that. If you want a specific shade from the bird itself,
            open any bird and hover the photo. You can copy the color straight
            from the image.
