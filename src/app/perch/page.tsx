            In the world I see, nature is already beautiful, and birds especially
            so. Look at almost any species and you&apos;ll find a color combination
            that feels complete in its own way: contrast, balance, and character
            already solved.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            I started Bird Palette to collect those combinations, real plumage
            colors, not guesses, and make them easy to browse and search. Take
            inspiration, or just wander through to see how many colors each bird
            carries and how they come together.

            Palettes are built from ornithological plumage data. Photos are
            from the field. Birds change with season, sex, and age, so what
            you see in the image may not line up with every swatch. That is
            expected, not an error.
